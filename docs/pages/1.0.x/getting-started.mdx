## What if we could turn back time ?

As builders, developers we want to build fast, started with legos and now building multi million dollar softwares, But developing a modern application lately has become painstakingly time consuming, with the variety of tech stacks, tools and the setup required just to get an app workinh, plus the  added overhead of making the right choices in terms of selecting tech stack forces us to focus more on the tools rather than the actual development. What if we could turn back time and developing application can be made as simplers as building with legos. The gluestack framework, started with the same vision to help you build and ship as faster as possible.


Excited? Waana see how it works ? 


The gluestack framework has two main parts the core app, which holds all of the pieces of your apps together, and plugins to add or remove various parts e.g. frontend/backend easily with just a command in your application.

Enough talk, let us show you the magic, just make sure you have the below prerequisites

``` 
Node ≥ 16.16.0 & NPM ≥ 8.11.0
Docker ≥ 20.10.21
```

Once you have the above installed on your system, let us get started on the journey, Run the following command

```
npx create-gluestack-app my-gluestack-app

OR

npm init gluestack-app my-gluestack-app
```

This will create the core for your project, with the bare minimum files and structure, a blank canvas with just the minimum required tools to supercharge your development. Next will dive deep into how to add various services to your new apps
