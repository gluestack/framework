# Plugins

Need to set up a modern frontend app or authentication or database etc, plugins are to the rescue, plugins are also referred as services, there are three major categories as of now

1. System: will provide functionalities such as spin-up modern frontends with highly performant UI libraries, authentication and much more
2. System Service: will provide functionalities to add services such as database, storage, hosting, etc.
3. Tools: tools to monitor your existing system with console and admins eg hasura console.

Let's add a next js app with the best industry practices for file structures and tools, with just a following command.

```
cd my-gluestack-app
node glue install web admin
```

That's it and it will setup a nextjs app with ui library in your project.
