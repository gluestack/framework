# Adding Web

This command helps you create a frontend workspace in your gluestack project.

```bash
node glue add web website

> Installing 'web' from '@gluestack/glue-plugin-web'

? Select template: > - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit.
>   next-gluestack-ts
    next-tailwind-ts
    next-ts

âœ” Select template: > next-ts
> Sucessfully installed 'web' as instance admin in directory './website'
```

## **The folder structure**

You get a Next.js app in `website` with the following folder structure.

```bash
.env
README.md
next.config.js
package.json
pages/
public/
router.js
styles
tsconfig.json
```

### **The** pages **folder**

In Next.js, a **page** is a [React Component](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html) exported from a `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, or `.tsx` file in the `pages` directory. Each page is associated with a route based on its file name.

**Example**: If you create `pages/about.js` that exports a React component like below, it will be accessible at `/about`.

```jsx
export default function About() {
  return <div>About</div>
}
```

### **The router.js file**

This file is treated as the upstream in the nginx configuration. It accepts following params in an array format:

- **path**: The path to match on
- **proxy**: The proxy configuration
- **proxy.path**: The path to match on the proxied configuration
- **size_in_mb**: The maximum size of the request body in megabytes, default is 50 mb

```jsx
module.exports = () => [
  {
    server_name: "website"
  },
  {
    path: '/(.*)',
    proxy: {
      path: '/$1',
      instance: "website:9000",
    },
    size_in_mb: '50',
  },
];
```

### **The package.json file**

Since the add web command scaffolds a Next.js project, all the dependencies and its related information are stored in `package.json` file.
