# Building GraphQL APIs

This command helps you create a graphql workspace in your gluestack project. 

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ graphql instance has a dependency on postgres instance

Use `node glue add postgres postgres` to install the postgres plugin

</aside>

After adding postgres instance, to add graphql, you should run the following command:

```bash
node glue add graphql graphql
```

- Your graphql instance will be installed into your **backend/services** directory

```bash
> Installing 'graphql' from '@gluestack/glue-plugin-graphql'
> Sucessfully installed 'graphql' as instance graphql in directory './backend/services/graphql'
```

## Attaching a REST Endpoint as GraphQL Action

This command helps you integrate a REST endpoint into a service and expose it as a GraphQL action. To add a new action, you should run the following command:

```bash
node glue function:attach-action

****? Select a service plugin > - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit.
>   @gluestack/glue-plugin-service-node - Select a language for your service

? Select an instance > - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit.
>   todos-services - Select auth-services instance

? Select a function > - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit.
>   list-todos
    function
    health-check
```

## **The folder structure**

You got two new files in **list-todos** function

```bash
list-todos/
->new  action.graphql
->new  action.setting
       handler.js
```
