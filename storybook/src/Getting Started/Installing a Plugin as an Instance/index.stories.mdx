# Installing a Plugin as an Instance

You can pull the basic web template by running the following command.

```bash
node glue add web dashboard  
```

The current version of the web plugin uses Next.js and the source code can be found at

`@gluestack/glue-plugin-web`on npm. This interactively takes the name of the web project. You may give it a name like `dashboard` or `landing`.

**Note:** You can create multiple web projects in the same gluestack app. We call them instances of web plugin.

```bash
node glue add web dashboard

> Installing 'web' from '@gluestack/glue-plugin-web'

? Select template: > - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit.
>   next-gluestack-ts
    next-tailwind-ts
    next-ts

âœ” Select template: > next-ts
> Sucessfully installed 'web' as instance dashboard in directory './dashboard'
```
