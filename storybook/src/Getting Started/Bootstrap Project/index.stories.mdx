# Bootstrap Project

## Create a gluestack app.

```bash
npx create-gluestack-app@latest my-gluestack-app
```

## The folder structure

You get a basic gluestack app with the following folder structure. This is a Node project. (This isn’t a monorepo yet).

```bash
.env
glue
meta/
package.json
README.md
```

### **The meta folder**

This folder keeps the config that’s needed by the framework. Plugins use this folder to store their persistent information too.

### **The glue command**

This is a Node.js file, a command that points to the CLI of the locally installed framework. We can use this by running `node glue`. Try it out to list the commands that are registered.

### **The package.json file**

Since the create-project command scaffolds a Node project, all the dependencies and its related information are stored in `package.json` file.
