# Building GraphQL APIs

This command helps you create a graphql workspace in your gluestack project.

Use `node glue add postgres postgres` to install the postgres plugin

After adding postgres instance, to add graphql, you should run the following command:

```bash
node glue add graphql graphql
```

- Your graphql instance will be installed into your **backend/services** directory
