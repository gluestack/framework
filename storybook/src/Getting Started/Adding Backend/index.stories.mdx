# Adding Backend

This command helps you configure backend engine in your gluestack porject.

```bash
node glue add backend-engine engine

> Installing 'backend-engine' from '@gluestack/glue-plugin-backend-engine'
> Sucessfully installed 'backend-engine' as instance engine in directory './backend/engine'
```

## **The folder structure**

You get a express.js app in `backend/engine` with the following folder structure.

```bash
.env
README.md
components
package.json
router.js
src/
```

## The **backend directory**

- **backend** directory if it does not exists in your gluestack project's root directory
- **backend/crons** directory with **crons.json** file which contains all your project specific CRONs
- **backend/events** directory with **app** and **database** sub-directories all your project specific events
    - **backend/events/app** directory will contain all the app events
    - **backend/events/database** directory will contain all the database events
- **backend/engine** directory contains the **gluestack backend engine server** which manages **Events**, **Crons** & **Queues**

### **The router.js file**

This file is treated as the upstream in the nginx configuration.

```jsx
module.exports = () => {
  return [
    {
      "path": "/backend/engine/(.*)",
      "proxy": {
        "instance": "engine:3500",
        "path": "/v1.0/invoke/engine/method/$1"
      }
    }
  ];
};
```

### **The package.json file**

Since the add backend-engine command scaffolds a express.js project, all the dependencies and its related information are stored in `package.json` file.
