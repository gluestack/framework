# Building REST APIs

This command helps you create a microservice in your gluestack project. To add a new service, you should run the following command:

```bash
node glue service:add
```

- This command will then ask you to "**Select a service plugin**" from a dropdown list. *Currently, we only support **@gluestack/glue-plugin-service-node** which is basically a microservice in NodeJS*
- Once you have selected the **service plugin**, then you will be asked to "**Enter the instance name**"
- That's it! Your new microservice with the provided name will be installed into your **backend/services** directory

```bash
node glue service:add

? Select a service plugin › - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit.
❯   @gluestack/glue-plugin-service-node - Select a language for your service

? Enter the instance name › todos-service

> Installing '@gluestack/glue-plugin-service-node' from '@gluestack/glue-plugin-service-node'
> Sucessfully installed '@gluestack/glue-plugin-service-node' as instance todos-service in directory './backend/services/todos-service'
```

## **The folder structure**

You get a express.js app in `backend/services/todos-service` with the following folder structure.

```bash
.env
.env.example
README.md
components
functions/
  function/
  health-check/
helpers/
package.json
router.js
server.js
```

On local dev, it will register routes such as: 

```bash
Loaded route /function from function/handler.js
Loaded route /health-check from health-check/handler.js
```

## Adding a REST Endpoint

```bash
node glue function:add list-todos

****? Select a service plugin › - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit.
❯   @gluestack/glue-plugin-service-node - Select a language for your service

? Select an instance › - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit.
❯   todos-service - Select todos-service instance

✔ Select an instance › todos-service
```

## **The folder structure**

You get a list-todos function in functions

```bash
functions/
       function/
       health-check/
->new  list-todos/
	       handler.js
```

On local dev, it will register a new route such as: 

```bash
Loaded route /list-todos from list-todos/handler.js
```
