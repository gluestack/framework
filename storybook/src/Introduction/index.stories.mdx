# Introduction to gluestack

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ gluestack is **not ready for production** use yet. The current version is an Early Developer Preview.

</aside>

gluestack is an open-source framework for building full-stack web and mobile apps.

The goal is to help you quickly turn your ideas into successful enterprises, so you can focus on solving real world problems rather than worrying about the engineering problems.

While almost everything is built as swappable modules, the recommended plugins include Next.js, Storybook, TypeScript, GraphQL, Hasura & Dapr for functions.

As of now, the mobile app plugin uses React Native. The UI components are shared between Web and Mobile with `@gluestack/ui`. We are considering Flutter, which is available as an experimental plugin for the mobile app.

## Features

- Initialize, develop and deploy full-stack apps with a CLI
- Clean and scalable API layer with a microservices architecture
- Database modeling & migrations
- Queue workers for background jobs
- Third-party integration with services for Messaging, Webhook, etc
- Plugin architecture to enhance the functionality of an app
- A platform to design & build components and share across web and mobile projects (Under R&D)
- Localisation and Internationalisation (Upcoming)
