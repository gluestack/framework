# Architecture

gluestack has two parts — A core and a set of core plugins on top of that.

# Part 1: The core

The core provides the foundation on which developers can build gluestack apps. The foundation includes an initial folder structure and a local CLI that helps them manage the plugins.

## The core facilitates:

- **Project init:** with `npx create-gluestack-app@latest`
- **A** p**latform for full-stack development:**
  - It gives a folder structure that’s editable by the developers
  - A local CLI per project to manage plugins.
- **A development runtime:**
  - **Webserver with a dynamic routing layer**
    - All the containers & processes are stitched together into a routing layer using Nginx
  - **Container & process manager**
    - Run and manage services as Containers (using Docker) or as System processes (using Nodemon) as requested by the plugins
  - **Env & config manager**
    - Facilitate the management and sharing of environment variables across containers and processes

- **A platform for plugin developers:**
  - The plugin developers can use the same development environment to init, develop and publish new plugins.
- **A runtime for plugins on CLI:**
  - Plugins can use the API provided by the core. The APIs let you
    - Add, run, and manage stateful services like databases (Postgres, Redis)
    - Add and manage stateless services like pgadmin, Hasura engine, and console
    - Inject templates in the gluestack project, such as the bootstrap of Next.js, React Native, and Storybook, that quickly lets the user start with the development.
    - Communicate with other plugins. Eg: The GraphQL plugin can notify other plugins when new entities are added, which the Next.js web plugin can consume to create Apollo hooks.

**NOTE:**

- We use NPM as the package manager, with the option to build plugins using JavaScript and TypeScript.
- Plugins can inject templates that don’t use the JavaScript ecosystem.
  - For eg: A plugin can inject a folder in the user’s folder to write Smart Contracts that use Solidity or Flutter that uses Dart.

# Part 2: Core Plugins (choose what you need)

We have also built a set of core plugins which are listed below. You can refer to the plugin reference section for each one of them.

- **web** (React with Next.js)
- **mobile** (React Native)
- **storybook** (Universal components)
- **auth**
- **graphql** (Hasura)
- **functions** (Dapr)
- **storage**
- **jobs**
- **cron**

We have an optional plugin that makes deploying any gluestack app to the Seal platform easy. Seal is a hosting service optimized and built for gluestack apps by the creators of gluestack.
