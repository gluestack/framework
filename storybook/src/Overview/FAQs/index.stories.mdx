# FAQs

You may have many questions as you start exploring gluestack. We have tried to list them here.

## Can I use gluestack only for the front-end or back-end?

Yes.

## Can I split the repo into smaller repos of web, mobile & APIs?

We don't have this feature as of now. We know that large projects may need this at some point for better access management & security. We will revisit this in our future releases. Git submodules look like a good option.

## Can I use gluestack on production (as of Jan 2023)?

Not yet. We have released an early developer preview and are collecting feedback from the community to improve the solution.

## What do I need to know before starting with gluestack?

The current stack of core plugins uses Next.js (React), GraphQL, Hasura, SQL, and TypeScript. The knowledge of these would help you with a quick start. But we do have a getting started guide if you're starting fresh.

## Is it just a container of different services (backend, front-end)?

gluestack does provide an environment to run different services, additionally, on top of that it also provides a dev environment, a unified runner, a routing layer, env management, a communication channel between the services that make the development a fullstack development.

## Will gluestack be paid in the future?

No, gluestack would always remain 100% open-source for developers to build full-stack web & mobile apps.

## Can I host a gluestack app on third-party cloud providers?

Yes. We don't have any lock-in of hosting gluestack on our servers. Although, we do have a paid hosting service called seal that makes the deployment as easy as running a command on the CLI.
