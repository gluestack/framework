# Goals and non-goals

### Goals of the core framework):

- Initialize a project with a CLI
- Provide a local CLI inside every project
- Don't ship anything functional with the initial bootstrap
- Enable full-stack developers to
  - Install plugins
  - Run the local dev environment
- Enable plugin developers to
  - Initialize, develop & publish plugins
  - Provide them with a persistent store where they can store meta information
- While the plugins are written in TypeScript / JavaScript, the templates of plugins aren't limited to TypeScript / JavaScript. For, eg, We have a plugin for Flutter.

### Non-goals of the core framework:

- The core has no opinion about what the plugin developers build, what language they may bring to the project and what they add to the user's project.

### Goals of the core plugins

We have built a set of plugins that helps you build full-stack apps.

- Every plugin brings in its own set of opinions.
- The core plugins make it easy to build a wide variety of web and mobile apps, from static websites to productivity apps, from e-commerce to social media apps.

### Non-goals of the core plugins

- The core plugins don't have any recommendations on building games or non-conventional apps. Although, you can build them on top of this framework.
