# Todo App with File Storage

Now we'll take a look at the **todo-app-storage** application. Navigate to the **todo-app-storage** directory from the project root.

```jsx
cd todo-app-storage
```

In this tutorial, we are using **storage** to store **files** associated with the todo. To achieve this, we have used the **Minio** and **storage** plugins. You can add these plugins by running the following commands:

```jsx
// add minio
node glue add minio minio

// add storage
node glue add storage storage
```

After installing the dependency, execute the command `node glue develop:up`. This will result in the addition of a new table named **files** to the database, as well as the inclusion of a new column named **file_id** in the **users** table.
