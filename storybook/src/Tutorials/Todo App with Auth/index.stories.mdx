# Todo App with Auth

Now we'll take a look at the **todo-app-auth** application. Navigate to the **todo-app-auth** directory from the project root.

```jsx
cd todo-app-auth
```

In this tutorial, **authentication** is enabled in the todo application. For **authentication**, we've used the **auth plugin**.

```jsx
node glue add auth auth
```

After installing, start the application by running this command: `node glue develop:up`. A new table named **users** will be automatically created in the database. 

Additionally, we have the **sign-in** and **sign-up** pages in the **todo-web** application.
