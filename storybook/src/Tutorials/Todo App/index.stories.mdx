# Todo App

We will go through a Todo application and understand the specific **plugins** that have been implemented. To do so, first, we need to clone it.

```jsx
git clone git@github.com:gluestack/todoapp-tailwind.git

// navigate into the project
cd todoapp-tailwind
```

We have four different types of **Todo** applications in this repository, including **Todo App**, **Todo App with Auth**, **Todo App with Mail**, and **Todo App with Storage**.

We will begin with the Todo app. Navigate to this folder.

```jsx
cd todo-app
```

In this application, we have used three plugins: **Postgres**, **GraphQL**, and **Web**.

```jsx
// Add PostgreSQL
node glue add postgres postgres

// Add GraphQL
node glue add graphql graphql

// Add web
node glue add web todo-web
```

After installing the node modules, start the application by running the command `node glue develop:up`. This will expose a GraphQL endpoint through Docker at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). By opening this in a browser, you can access the **Hasura console**, which is connected to the **Postgres** database.

Here, you can see that the **todos** table already exists.


## Todo Web

In the **todo-web** directory, there is a **codegen.ts** file used for generating the GraphQL schema. The todo GraphQL queries and mutations can be found in the **services/graphql** directory.

Now, open the Todoweb endpoint from Docker, where you will see the Todo application running.
