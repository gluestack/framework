# Todo App with Auth & Mail

Now we'll take a look at the **todo-app-auth-mail** application. Navigate to the **todo-app-auth-mail** directory from the project root.

```jsx
cd todo-app-auth-mail
```

In this tutorial, we are using **nodemailer plugin** to send an **email** when a user is registered. To add **nodemailer** to our application, you can use this command.

```jsx
node glue add service-nodemailer nodemailer
```

We created a **microservice** called **auth-service** to configure nodemailer. This **microservice** contains a function called **user-created** which, when called, sends an **email** to the user.

```jsx
node glue fucntion:add <function-name>
```

To ensure that a **welcome email** is sent to users upon signup, we need to add an **event** in Hasura that triggers whenever a new user is created. This can be done by running the following command.

```jsx
node glue event:add 
```

While installing, you will be prompted to provide the **table** name and **function** name.

After installing, start the application by running this command: `node glue develop:up`. Now, every time a new user signs up, a welcome email will be sent to the user.
