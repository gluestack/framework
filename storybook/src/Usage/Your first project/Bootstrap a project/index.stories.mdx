# Bootstrap a project

To bootstrap a project run the command

```jsx
npx create-gluestack-app@latest <project-name>
```

Running this command will initialize the gluestack core framework which is a node application and give you a folder structure like this:

```jsx
<project-name>/
	meta/
		plugin-instances.json
		plugins.json
	node_modules/
	glue.js
	package.json
	package-lock.json
	README.md
```

The framework provides you with a JS file `glue` using which you can interact and perform all actions provided by the framework using node. Examples:

```jsx
> node glue --version   -> prints the installed version of the framework.
> *node glue --help      -> prints the all the commands available in the framework.*
```
