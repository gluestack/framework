# Installation

You need Node 16.x and Docker’s latest version (to run plugins like pgadmin & Hasura).

## **Step 1: Create** a gluestack app.

```bash
npx create-gluestack-app@latest my-gluestack-app
```

## **Step 2: The folder structure**

You get a basic gluestack app with the following folder structure. This is a Node project. (This isn’t a monorepo yet).

```bash
/meta
glue
package.json
README.md
```

### The meta folder

This folder keeps the config that’s needed by the framework. Plugins use this folder to store their persistent information too.

### The glue command

This is a Node.js file, a command that points to the CLI of the locally installed framework. We can use this by running `node glue`. Try it out to list the commands that are registered.

### The `package.json` file

Since the create-project command scaffolds a Node project, all the dependencies and its related information are stored in `package.json` file.

## **Step 3:** Add your first plugin

You can pull the basic web template by running the following command.

```bash
node glue add web
```

The current version of the web plugin uses Next.js and the source code can be found at `@gluestack/glue-plugin-web` on npm. This interactively asks for the name of the web project. You may give it a name like `dashboard` or `landing`.

> **Note:** You can create multiple web projects in the same gluestack app. We call them instances of web plugin.

## Step 4: Run the local dev environment

```bash
npm run dev
```

You can then run any of the following commands as usual.

```bash
npm start
npm test
npm build
```
